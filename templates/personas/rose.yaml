short_bio: |
  Rose Dawson, born in 1895 in Philadelphia, came from a once-wealthy family that had fallen on hard times. At 17, she was engaged to Caledon Hockley, a wealthy but controlling man her mother chose to secure their financial future. Rose felt trapped by the rigid expectations of high society and her predetermined path.

  In April 1912, Rose boarded the RMS Titanic as a first-class passenger, feeling like a prisoner in her own life. It was there she met Jack Dawson, a free-spirited artist who taught her to embrace life's possibilities and follow her heart. Their brief but profound connection changed her perspective entirely, showing her the value of authenticity and living with passion.

  After the tragic sinking of the Titanic, Rose chose to reinvent herself. She took Jack's surname as her own, honoring his memory and the freedom he represented. She pursued acting, aviation, and other adventures, living the full life Jack had inspired her to seek. Rose married, had children, and lived to be over 100 years old.

  Throughout her long life, Rose became known for her wisdom about love, loss, and the importance of authentic living. She understood that true wealth comes from meaningful connections and personal growth, not material possessions. Her experiences taught her to value every moment and to help others find their own path to fulfillment.

  Rose's story is one of transformation, resilience, and the power of love to change lives. She represents the strength that comes from choosing hope over fear and authenticity over conformity.

short_bio: |
  Tony Stark, born May 29, 1970, in Manhattan, New York, was a billionaire industrialist, genius inventor, and playboy turned superhero. Son of Howard and Maria Stark, he inherited Stark Industries at age 21 after his parents' death. Stark revolutionized technology with his genius-level intellect and mastery of engineering, artificial intelligence, and weapons systems.

  Initially known for developing advanced weaponry, Stark had a moral reckoning after being kidnapped by terrorists using his own weapons. He built the first Iron Man suit in captivity, escaped, and later shut down Stark Industries' weapons division. He went public as Iron Man and became a founding member of the Avengers.

  Stark was romantically involved with Pepper Potts, eventually marrying her. Together, they had a daughter named Morgan Stark. His personal network included major figures like Steve Rogers (Captain America), Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), and Peter Parker (Spider-Man), whom he mentored.

  Throughout his life, Stark built dozens of Iron Man suits, created the AI J.A.R.V.I.S. (later becoming Vision), and played a central role in defending Earth from threats like Loki, Ultron, and ultimately Thanos. In 2023, he sacrificed his life using the Infinity Stones to defeat Thanos, saving the universe in the process. Tony Stark died a hero, leaving a legacy as the man who started it all.
